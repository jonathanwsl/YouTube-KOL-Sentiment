b,2,Good knowledge on the different features  between the two phones and different comparison. A summary of both phones at the end would be helpful. 
b,2,Amazing!  Thank you for sharing the amazing technology in the new iPhone13 Pro
c,3,I feel that she is overselling the iphone as she exaggerates on the plus points of the phone. She didn't mention about the cons of the phone. Could be she is paid or sponsored by Apple. Nevertheless it is still an informative and entertaining video about the phone

d,4,"Interesting, fun to watch, and insightful, but very long"
d,4,Succinctly describes the main differences between iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 13 pro max as well as differences between the 13pro and 13. Points out special features of the phone. Video shot in an interesting and stylish manner.
d,4,"Very clear and down to earth review of the phone, scenarios of how a normal users would use the phone are much appreciated "
d,4,Creative and content is good 
d,4,Doesn't matter to me because I just don't think it's practical to spend the money on a phone.
d,4,"As an iPhone user who love taking photo but never thought of getting a pro max model because i always think it is unnecessary, your video makes me want to get one. The photo and video taken by 13 pro max are really nice! Love the way you do review and compare to another model, and love the fun and your energy too!"
d,4,"Overtly dramatic girl,  tone down on the dramatised expressions.  But overall, great cinematography and the music is sweet."
d,4,A lot of practical applications of the phones features. She used it in many street and urban areas to demonstrate it. She was also engaging and knowledgeable of what she was doing. 
d,4,Great editing!
d,4,Very fun yet detailed and comprehensive review with actual footages and comparisons of the latest iPhone13 Pro. Great job Justine
d,4,Someone who was paid to promote iphone pro.
d,4,The review is a fresh take on how reviews are done with real life examples.
d,4,Great review!
