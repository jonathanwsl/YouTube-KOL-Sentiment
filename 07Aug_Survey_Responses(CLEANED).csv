c,3,No,Yes,"To me, it was a very professionally done video.  She really highlighted all the great features of the phone and made really good use of the videos and photos to justify them, especially the macro feature.  While there might be post- production editing involved, I really like the side by side comparisons.",No,No,A lot more talking compared to the other video and a lot of indoor filming makes me feel like attending a lecture or a sales talk.  There is little background music like the other video.  There is little side by side comparisons which I liked. 
d,4,No,No,"Why only about the camera? I can’t use camera phones at work. What about the other features of the phone? There is more to a phone than just a camera, unless iPhone 13 pro got nothing new to feature other than the camera ",No,No,Only shows that Apple ran out of new ideas and lost its touch in innovating.

b,2,No,No,"Yet another iPhone. I dont need such a good camera, yet from this video thats my main takeaway. In fact, most people do not require such a good camera. This video makes me believe that other than the camera, the new iPhone is about the same as the few before it.",No,No,"This video talks a lot more about the inner working of the iPhone and how it can process things faster. Although its evident that all this technology already exists, yet is only now then applied to this version. While the cameras may be useful for a youtuber, the same cannot be said for most other people. It is hence evident how useless all these upgrades are, and Im convinced to just wait for the next one."

I loved how you showed side by side comparisons - I know which model is a good fit for me now. ,No,Yes,Super thorough review and you definitely know what us phone geeks wanna know!
