"Her reviews mostly positive.  Not credible, someone script for her?"
the macro mode and video of the nee iPhone13 is really cool. I am really impressed. Love the music and the video is very well edited. very well made
I feel that she is overselling the iphone as she exaggerates on the plus points of the phone. She didn't mention about the cons of the phone. Could be she is paid or sponsored by Apple. Nevertheless it is still an informative and entertaining video about the phone
"Love the in-depth dive into the cameras for the phones, definitely a nice upgrade. "
Focused on the camera. I believe there are phones with better cameras. I'm not a fan of apple
"Interesting, fun to watch, and insightful, but very long"
Wow!!! Iphone 13 Pro Max features are super upgrade! Thank you for the detailed review!
Great shots. 
Don’t exaggerate 
Succinctly describes the main differences between iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 13 pro max as well as differences between the 13pro and 13. Points out special features of the phone. Video shot in an interesting and stylish manner.
"Very clear and down to earth review of the phone, scenarios of how a normal users would use the phone are much appreciated "
Not convinced. 
"Interesting! She shows the different photo modes for the iphone which i didnt know was possible, this allows me to take more photos i like in a different way!"
Cinematic is helpful feature to take video and photo quality is vivid.
Creative and content is good 
Doesn't matter to me because I just don't think it's practical to spend the money on a phone.
Really enjoyed the tour around! I had fun 'hanging out' with you while you reviewed the phone :)
Great content on the macro and cinematic modes!
I really enjoyed the video! The quality of the iphone 13 pro max camera is amazing!

"As an iPhone user who love taking photo but never thought of getting a pro max model because i always think it is unnecessary, your video makes me want to get one. The photo and video taken by 13 pro max are really nice! Love the way you do review and compare to another model, and love the fun and your energy too!"
Very informative and upbeat
in depth explanation of details on the phone 
.
Lengthy but good comparisons.

She’s doing a review for iPhone 13 pro for those that don’t know the functions of it. 
iPhone 13 pro rocks!
The video is well taken.
Not bad. Straight to the point. 
"Overtly dramatic girl,  tone down on the dramatised expressions.  But overall, great cinematography and the music is sweet."
A lot of practical applications of the phones features. She used it in many street and urban areas to demonstrate it. She was also engaging and knowledgeable of what she was doing. 
Amazing review on the cameras. The front camera seems really good!
Great editing!
Long-winded.
None
informative but the repetitiveness and focus on the camera made me skip through till the end
Very fun yet detailed and comprehensive review with actual footages and comparisons of the latest iPhone13 Pro. Great job Justine
Someone who was paid to promote iphone pro.
The review is a fresh take on how reviews are done with real life examples.
Good knowledge on the different features  between the two phones and different comparison. A summary of both phones at the end would be helpful. 
"Good feedback and review, based on daily tasks and possible usage."
Great review!
Amazing!  Thank you for sharing the amazing technology in the new iPhone13 Pro
Pretty good but way too long.
